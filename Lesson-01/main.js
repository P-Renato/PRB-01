ECMAScript ***********
Js is based pm ECMAScript (ES)
It is a standardized specification for scrippting languages.
It defines the syntax, semantics and core feature of the language.

NODE ***********
Node is a runtime environment for executing JS code outside of a browser.
Js would natively only run in the browser.. with node we can now run Js elsewhere as well.
Let's try to run a js file in the CLI (command line interface)
